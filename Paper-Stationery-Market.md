According to a report from Statista, the global paper stationery market was valued at approximately USD 50 billion in 2018 and saw a slight dip in growth over the next few years.</p><ul> <li><strong>Digital Impact:</strong> The increasing use of smartphones, tablets, and laptops to replace paper for everyday tasks, from note-taking to office work, was a major factor in the slowdown.</li> <li><strong>Sustainability Trends:</strong> There was an uptick in demand for eco-friendly paper products, with consumers becoming more aware of environmental issues.
