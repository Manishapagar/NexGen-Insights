The global market was valued at around USD 2.5 billion in 2018, and by 2022, it had expanded at a modest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4%. This period was characterized by several key drivers:</p><ul> <li><strong>Health and Wellness Trends:</strong> As consumers became more health-conscious, liquorice's appeal as a natural sweetener and herbal remedy grew. It was increasingly used in sugar-free candies, herbal teas, and dietary supplements.</li> <li><strong>Food and Beverage Applications:</strong> The use of liquorice in confectionery, especially in European and North American markets, remained strong. Liquorice extracts were also gaining popularity in innovative food products.</li> <li><strong>Medicinal Use:</strong> Liquorice’s use in the pharmaceutical industry also remained stable, particularly in gastrointestinal and respiratory health.</li> <li><strong>Supply Chain Challenges:</strong> The market faced challenges related to raw material availability, particularly due to the limited growing regions (mainly in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East), which resulted in occasional price hikes.</li></ul><h2>What Does the Future Hold for the Liquorice Market (2023–2033)?</h2><p>Looking forward to the 2023-2033 period, the global liquorice market is projected to grow at a faster pace.

The U.S. and parts of Asia, such as China and India, were also significant players, though their consumption was more focused on the pharmaceutical and herbal segments. By 2023, however, the geographic dynamics are shifting:</p><ul> <li><strong>Europe:</strong> Expected to remain the largest market, though growth rates may slow as saturation occurs in certain product categories like candy.</li> <li><strong>Asia-Pacific:</strong> Projected to see the highest growth rate due to rising awareness about the health benefits of liquorice, especially in natural medicine.</li> <li><strong>North America:</strong> The demand for liquorice-based natural sweeteners and herbal products will continue to increase, with a strong focus on functional foods.</li> <li><strong>Latin America & Middle East:</strong> These regions are expected to witness steady demand driven by the increasing popularity of herbal teas and natural remedies.</li></ul><h2>Key Factors Influencing Liquorice Market Demand (2023–2033)</h2><p>Several key factors are expected to drive the liquorice market over the next decade:</p><ul> <li><strong>Health and Wellness Trends:</strong> As consumers continue to prioritize natural ingredients in their diets, liquorice’s role in health and wellness will expand. It is seen as a remedy for digestive issues, sore throats, and even stress reduction, leading to greater adoption in supplements and functional foods.</li> <li><strong>Consumer Preference for Natural Sweeteners:</strong> With sugar reduction becoming a priority for many consumers, liquorice’s natural sweetness is expected to meet the demand for sugar alternatives in the confectionery industry.</li> <li><strong>Increased Focus on Sustainable Agriculture:</strong> As global attention on sustainable agriculture practices rises, the liquorice industry will need to adopt practices that minimize environmental impact while meeting growing demand.</li> <li><strong>Research & Development:</strong> Innovations in liquorice-based products and the discovery of new uses will continue to shape market demand.
